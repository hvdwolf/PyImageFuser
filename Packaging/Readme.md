# Building distributable binaries

In here you will find the the scripts and config file I use to build distributable binaries.
They all work with relative paths the way I have set them up in my 3 systems.
These scripts and source code tree do not contain the pre-compiled enfuse and align_image_stack packaged in the AppImage, the Windows build and the MacOS bundel (and contain neither the scripts I use to make enfuse and align_image_stack distributable).  
PyInstaller is use to make the python binaries for the several platforms.

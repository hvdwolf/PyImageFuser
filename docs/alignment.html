OpenCV offers multiple alignment options. In PyImageFuser we can use a number of those alignment methods being:
<ul>
<li>ECC: Enhanced Correlation Coefficient (ECC) Maximization</li>
<li>AlignMTB: This algorithm converts images to median threshold bitmaps (1 for pixels brighter than median luminance and 0 otherwise) and than aligns the resulting bitmaps using bit operations. It is invariant to exposure, so exposure values and camera response are not necessary.</li>
<li>ORB: Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF</li>
</ul>

ECC is not feature based. It is a motion model alignment algorithm.
SIFT, SURF and ORB are feature based

<H2>ECC motion models:</H2>
<ul>
<li>Translation ( MOTION_TRANSLATION ) : The first image can be shifted ( translated ) by (x , y) to obtain the second image. There are only two parameters x and y that we need to estimate.</li>
<li>Euclidean ( MOTION_EUCLIDEAN ) : The first image is a rotated and shifted version of the second image. So there are three parameters â€” x, y and angle . You will notice in Figure 4, when a square undergoes Euclidean transformation, the size does not change, parallel lines remain parallel, and right angles remain unchanged after transformation.</li>
<li>Affine ( MOTION_AFFINE ) : An affine transform is a combination of rotation, translation ( shift ), scale, and shear. This transform has six parameters. When a square undergoes an Affine transformation, parallel lines remain parallel, but lines meeting at right angles no longer remain orthogonal.</li>
<li>Homography ( MOTION_HOMOGRAPHY ) : All the transforms described above are 2D transforms. They do not account for 3D effects. A homography transform on the other hand can account for some 3D effects ( but not all ). This transform has 8 parameters. A square when transformed using a Homography can change to any quadrilateral.</li>
</ul>

In the MergeMertens exposure fusion algorithm pixels are weighted using contrast, saturation and well-exposedness measures, than images are combined using laplacian pyramids.

The resulting image weight is constructed as weighted average of contrast, saturation and well-exposedness measures.

The resulting image doesn't require tonemapping and can be converted to 8-bit image by multiplying by 255, but it's recommended to apply gamma correction and/or linear tonemapping.

The MergeMertens class is described <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/dd6/classcv_1_1MergeMertens.html" target="#">here</a>.

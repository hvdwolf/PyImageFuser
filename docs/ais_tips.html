<li>In hand-held images ALWAYS use the "-C" parameter to crop the images so that all images contain the same information. 
This to prevent strange "frames" on the edges where one image contains (well exposed, well saturated) information the others have not.</li>

<li>Increase the number of control points. The standard is eight ("-c 8"). Raise this number to 20, 50 or 100. 
Alignment can improve and will never get worse. It will only take (much) longer.<br>
Note that smaller image (previews!) might need more Control Points than the large orginal images, because the smaller images lose detail!</li>

<li>Play around with the required correlation between control points. The standard value is "--corr=0.9", so if align_image_stack still 
fails to align images in spite of the higher number of control points, you can lower this to "--corr=0.8" or even down to "--corr=0.5". 
Of course, that way the program will also include very bad matches - but this is usually offset by the much larger number of control points.<br>
(Or the other way round: you can also increase the correlation value to "0.95" or "0.99" if alignment is too easy to begin with.)</li>

<li>Increase the error margin for matches. The default are three pixels ("-t 3"), but usually applying steps 2. and 3. is enough to solve the problem.</li>

<li>If there is a rather large shift between your pictures, you can try lowering the grid size. The standard value is "-g 5", so the align_image_stack looks for 
common points in a 5x5 grid. "-g 3" or "-g 2" for a 3x3 or 2x2 grid, respectively, can be useful for difficult images. 
Remember to increase the number of control points because the cells get larger (see 2.).</li>

<li>Use other options (like -m -d -i -x -y -z, for optimizing several things), but ONLY when you need them - and they're rarely needed when you photograph 
distant objects. They give the program large room to "correct" alignments, but with sometimes drastically distorted images.</li>

<li>Remember to set "--use-given-order" when your pictures have the same exposure like in "noise reduction" stacks. Otherwise, align_image_stack will 
process the brightest image first, and the darkest one last - something you want for your exposure bracketing, but not when 
you do noise reduction on a stack of 4-20 equally exposed images.</li>
